# **Amazon Recommender System**

**Giana Grace and Natalie Dume**

# INTRO

This dataset provides a detailed overview of consumer purchases on Amazon, encompassing a wide range of data collected over several years from various categories and regions. The dataset includes essential information such as customer demographics, product details, transaction amounts, purchase frequencies, and associated sales in dollars. It also contains specific details on product categories, pricing, user ratings, and reviews. By analyzing trends across the dataset, key insights into Amazonâ€™s consumer behavior patterns, regional purchasing trends, and the economic impact of e-commerce on customer spending habits can be uncovered.

Amazon purchases are primarily driven by two factors: product diversity and price sensitivity. Higher purchase volumes, particularly in terms of product categories and quantities sold, have a direct correlation with higher overall sales revenue. Additionally, products with more competitive pricing and favorable customer reviews tend to experience higher sales due to consumer trust and price-conscious behavior. Regional differences, such as higher sales in urban areas compared to rural regions, may also reflect varying consumer preferences and disposable income levels.

The core challenge in e-commerce platforms is providing personalized product recommendations that match individual user preferences. Most existing recommendation systems either focus on collaborative filtering (user-item interaction data) or content-based filtering (product attributes), but each has its limitations. Collaborative filtering struggles with cold-start problems (new users or items), while content-based filtering often lacks personalization based on user behavior.

To gain deeper insights and make more accurate predictions regarding Amazon purchases, a recommender system was employed. This approach is well-suited for identifying important factors that influence consumer purchase behavior, such as product categories, pricing, and customer reviews. Our research question is: How can we personalize the customer's shopping experience to increase the likelihood of purchases through recommendations?

Our research seeks to address this problem by using a deep learning-based hybrid recommendation system. This system combines user interaction data (e.g., clicks, views) with product attributes (e.g., price, category) to deliver more tailored and relevant recommendations for users. By applying deep learning models, the system will learn both latent user preferences and item features, offering a richer personalized shopping experience.

 The model helps in understanding how different features contribute to purchase variability, uncovering key drivers of consumer spending on Amazon.

"""First, the values in the rating column of the metadata DataFrame are converted to numeric values. Any non-numeric values are replaced with NaN (Not a Number). This conversion is important because the ratings need to be in numeric form for statistical analysis. Then, the average of all the movie ratings in the rating column is computed using .mean(), and the result is stored in the variable C. This gives the average rating across the dataset, which might later be used as a baseline for further analysis or model building. Those that fall into the top 10% of rating_count are likely the most popular or widely reviewed. Filtering the dataset to include only these  can help focus on high-quality or widely-engaged content, which might be more relevant in building a recommendation model.
By selecting only the top 90th percentile, the dataset becomes smaller and more manageable, which helps with computational efficiency when training machine learning models. This will also aid in removing outliers.

Weighted ranking: The primary goal is to rank products in a way that accounts for both their average rating and the number of ratings. This avoids biasing the ranking toward products with only a few ratings, which could distort the perception of quality.

"""# CONCLUSION

By combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the personalization of the shopping experience is achieved through leveraging user interaction data by analyzing user behavior, such as clicks and views, which allowed the model to learn individual preferences. This understanding allows for more tailored recommendations that align with users' past behaviors and interests.
The model also considers key product features, including pricing and categories, which are essential factors influencing purchase decisions. By integrating these attributes into the recommendation process, the system can suggest products that not only resonate with user preferences but also offer competitive pricing. We attempted to reference across users, however, we found difficulty using simulated data.
The model helps mitigate issues associated with new users or items, as it uses both historical interaction data and content attributes. This approach ensures that even when user interaction data is sparse, the model can still provide relevant recommendations based on product characteristics.
Additonally, focusing on reviews and ratings let's the system suggest highly-rated products, thereby increasing consumer trust and satisfaction. Positive reviews can influence usersâ€™ purchasing decisions, leading to higher sales conversion rates.

The Amazon recommender system provides a robust framework for personalizing the shopping experience. By utilizing deep learning techniques and a hybrid approach to recommendations, the system can enhance user engagement, increase purchase likelihood, and ultimately contribute to improved consumer satisfaction and sales for Amazon. By creating a more personalized shopping experience, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction and increase the likelihood of purchases, driving higher sales and customer loyalty.
