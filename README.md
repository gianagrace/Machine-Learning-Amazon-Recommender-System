This dataset provides a detailed overview of consumer purchases on Amazon, encompassing a wide range of data collected over several years from various categories and regions. The dataset includes essential information such as customer demographics, product details, transaction amounts, purchase frequencies, and associated sales in dollars. It also contains specific details on product categories, pricing, user ratings, and reviews. By analyzing trends across the dataset, key insights into Amazonâ€™s consumer behavior patterns, regional purchasing trends, and the economic impact of e-commerce on customer spending habits can be uncovered.

Amazon purchases are primarily driven by two factors: product diversity and price sensitivity. Higher purchase volumes, particularly in terms of product categories and quantities sold, have a direct correlation with higher overall sales revenue. Additionally, products with more competitive pricing and favorable customer reviews tend to experience higher sales due to consumer trust and price-conscious behavior. Regional differences, such as higher sales in urban areas compared to rural regions, may also reflect varying consumer preferences and disposable income levels.

The core challenge in e-commerce platforms is providing personalized product recommendations that match individual user preferences. Most existing recommendation systems either focus on collaborative filtering (user-item interaction data) or content-based filtering (product attributes), but each has its limitations. Collaborative filtering struggles with cold-start problems (new users or items), while content-based filtering often lacks personalization based on user behavior.

To gain deeper insights and make more accurate predictions regarding Amazon purchases, a recommender system was employed. This approach is well-suited for identifying important factors that influence consumer purchase behavior, such as product categories, pricing, and customer reviews. Our research question is: How can we personalize the customer's shopping experience to increase the likelihood of purchases through recommendations?

Our research seeks to address this problem by using a deep learning-based hybrid recommendation system. This system combines user interaction data (e.g., clicks, views) with product attributes (e.g., price, category) to deliver more tailored and relevant recommendations for users. By applying deep learning models, the system will learn both latent user preferences and item features, offering a richer personalized shopping experience.
